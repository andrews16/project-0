    This is a tool for proctors, chairpeople, presentors, teachers, and meeting leaders everywhere.
    The sleek and simple website assists with all of you pre-meeting preparations.
    
    - Stay on time with a live clock.
    
    - During that 15-minutes before the start of you meeting, instead of scratching down your talking points on a notebook, type them out here.
    - Keep all your nessecary links one click away by adding them to the screen.
    - 
    
    You can generate an icebreaker question for small get-to-know eachother meetings.
    You can randomly get a food category if you're scheduling a larger lunch meeting.
